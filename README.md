# aim5005_midterm

The assignment is submitted via this github link. The folder includes three documents, the data accident.csv file, the .py file, and the midterm report. 

The folder enables the direct work of the pd.read_csv if downloaded to local devices. I used python3 to run the .py file through the Mac terminal.
